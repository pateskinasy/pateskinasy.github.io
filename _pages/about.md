Now busy with own project (in stealth).

Then: A fifteen years' career in B2B deep-tech across 4 continents.

I dig making really complex stuff simple and am a massive product geek. As an Engineer and Economist, I am fascinated by decentralization (yes, I'll probably read - or skim - your white paper if I come across it). Specially interested in initiatives that help boost economic empowerment.

Otherwise, you'll find me with ∞ tabs open in my browser, eating 🌱 food, doing Yoga or jogging.

The best way to contact me is [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/celue). Otherwise, feel free to reach out [here](/contact).

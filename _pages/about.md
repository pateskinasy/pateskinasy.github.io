Hi, I'm Pat Eskinasy.

On this site, you’ll find my writings on some of my favourite things:

<p class="notice">
  <strong>Decentralized and Distributed systems | Open Source Software | Digital Privacy | Artificial Intelligence | Cryptocurrency | Data Science | Product Management | InfoSec | Leadership | Decentralized Governance | Supply Chains | Ethical Design | Economics | Economic Empowerment | Plant-Based Lifestyle | Yoga | Jogging | Venture Capital | Capital Markets | Startups</strong>
</p>

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/celue), [Medium](https://medium.com/@celue), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/pateskinasy) and [Github](https://github.com/pateskinasy). You may also join my (infrequent) email [Newsletter](https://upscri.be/611534).

The best way to contact me is [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/celue). Otherwise, drop a note [here](/contact).

I'm now busy with own project (in stealth).

Then: A fifteen years' career in B2B deep-tech across 4 continents.

I dig making really complex stuff simple and am a massive product geek. As an Engineer and Economist, I am fascinated by decentralization (yes, I'll probably read - or skim - your white paper if I come across it). Specially interested in initiatives that help boost economic empowerment.

Otherwise, you'll find me with ∞ tabs open in my browser, eating 🌱 food, doing yoga or jogging.

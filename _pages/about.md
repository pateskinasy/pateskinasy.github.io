Hi, Hej, Olá,

I'm Pat.

On this site, you’ll find my writings on some of my favourite things:

</p>

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/celue), [Medium](https://medium.com/@celue), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/pateskinasy) and [Github](https://github.com/pateskinasy). You should join my (infrequent) email [Newsletter](https://upscri.be/611534) for more content not published here.

The best way to contact me is [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/celue). Otherwise, drop a note [here](/contact).

I'm now busy with own projects. Most recently [hen.ai](https://www.hen.ai) and [creatorstory](https://www.creatorstory.com).

Past: A fifteen years' career of global technology and business experience at both multinational organizations and startups across 4 continents (including **Taiwan, South Africa, Brazil, Finland, Sweden and United Kingdom**).

I am curious about everything, dig making really complex stuff simple and am a massive product geek. Being an **Engineer** and an **Economist**, I predictably (yes, I know...) became fascinated by decentralization and federation (i.e., I'll probably read - or skim - your white paper if I come across it). I'm specially interested in initiatives that help boost economic empowerment.

Otherwise, you'll find me with ∞ tabs open in my browser, eating 🌱 food, practicing yoga, jogging or enjoying the outdoors.
